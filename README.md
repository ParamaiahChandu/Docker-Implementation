# Docker-Implementation  
To pull the docker image, run the command 'docker pull chanduph/7c9e19b286b0' in the command prompt.  
Then we have to run 'docker run -p 8081:80 chanduph/7c9e19b286b0' command to run the docker.  
After running these commands, we have to open ' http://localhost:8081/web/' link in browser. If the calender is not visible beside 'Forecast Weather' button, enter the date you want to forecast in the 'yyyy-mm-dd' format, i.e., 20180101.
